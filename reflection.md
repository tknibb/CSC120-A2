Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I first did the entire code with the inventory as a dictionary instead of a list and then I changed it to list. 

What worked for me for starting the code was watching a youtude video that explained OOP a little more and working on it with friends. 

What didn't work was just staring at the code and thinking about how I dont understand it. 

The advice I'd give someone taking this course is to take breaks and ask for help.
